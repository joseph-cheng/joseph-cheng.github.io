    <hr>

    As part of my final year at university, I completed a software engineering project as well as a dissertation. The title of the project was <i>Identifying Pianists Through Audio of a Performance</i> and was a software project involving the design and development of a novel system that was able to detect the performer of a particular piece of piano music, from the raw audio signal alone.

    <br>

    For example, if 10 pianists played the same piano piece and you recorded each of them, and you got one of the 10 pianists to play the piece again, the system would attempt to tell which of the original 10 pianists played the piece the second time.

    <br>
    <br>

    On my particular dataset, the system was able to achieve an accuracy of around 80%, where random would have given an accuracy of 14%. The system was also resistant against transformations like the addition of background noise or reverb.
