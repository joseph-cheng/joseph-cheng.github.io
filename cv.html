<h2>PROJECTS</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/joseph-cheng/process-injection"><b>Windows Process Injector</b></a> (external)

<p>Using C, C++, and x64 assembly, I wrote a tool that implemented many process injection techniques such as reflective injection, hooking, module stomping, and gargoyle. Since the original gargoyle PoC was only for x86, I had to write novel code to implement it for x64.</p>

<br>

<a href="https://github.com/joseph-cheng/3d-boids"><b>3D Boids Simulation</b></a> (external)
<p>Using C++ and OpenGL, I wrote a 3D boids (flocking artificial birds) simulation optimised using an octree data structure and utilizing geometry shaders for more performance speedups, making it easily capable of handling 2000+ boids at 60fps.</p>
<br>

<a href="https://github.com/joseph-cheng/part-ii-project"><b>Pianist Identification from Audio</b></a> (external)
<p>Using Python, for my 3rd year project at university I designed and implemented a system to identify the performer of a piece of piano music from a recorded audio signal. Using techniques from digital signal processing, music information retrieval, and information theory, this system was able to achieve an 80% success rate.</p>

<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<b>F-Secure Security Consulting Internship</b>
<span style="float:right;">
  <i>September 2021 - September 2021</i>
</span>
</p>
<p>
This internship involved an intense month of training in various cybersecurity topics, covering appsec, netsec, the cloud, cryptography, and more, and culminated in a 6 week research project where I independently produced a tool (the Windows Process Injector), as well as a blog post published on the internal blog that detailed process injection and my tool, and also a presentation given to the entire consultancy on my project.
</p>

<h2>INTERESTS</h2>

<b>Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions</b>
<p>Participated/participating in a number of CTF competitions such as picoCTF and C2C CTF, requiring understanding of cryptography, knowledge of binary exploitation, and programming skills. This involved undergoing heavy amounts of independent research and problem solving skills against the clock.</p>
<br>

<b>Wargames</b>
<p>Completed a number of wargames, such as those offered on OverTheWire, requiring comprehensive knowledge of Unix tools, cryptanalysis, and web security.</p>

<hr>
<h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
<p>Medal winner in the 2016 National Cipher Challenge and achieved full points in the 2018 National Cipher Challenge. This required collaboration in a team and having to problem solve under pressure to very tight deadlines.</p>

<p>Hosted a programming club at my school for a year, allowing me to teach younger students about concepts within programming, as well as working with peers on computing projects.</p>


<p>Received the Distinguished Talk Award from the Churchill College Computer Science Talks in the 2020/2021 year for a talk on searchable encryption.</p>

<hr>
<h2>EXTRA-CURRICULAR</h2>
<p>I am a dedicated piano player, winning two silver medals in competition.</p>

<p>I mentor and tutor state-school students through the Zero Gravity platform, helping to provide access to the top UK universities to those who might not have it otherwise.</p>
