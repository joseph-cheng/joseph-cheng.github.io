    <h1>MUSIC</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>I love music! I started to form my music taste in around 2018 with indie rock, cloud rap, and PC music. You can find my last.fm <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/ssccrrbbll">here</a>.

    A few of my favourite artists/bands are listed below, as well as my favourite song from each of them:</p>

    I'll listen to pretty much any music, feel free to send me any recommendations via email! Right now, I'm enjoying a lot of downtempo classics, as well as some indie rock/pop.

    <h2>Concerts</h2>

    I've currently only been to a few concerts, but I have plans/tickets for many others:

    <dl>
      <dd>Drain Gang World Tour </dd>
      <dd>Ecco2K | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWl6ryrDBUY">this</a> (external) is still one of my favourite memories (you can see me in this video as well! Yellow/blonde hair in the bottom-left at 0:47)</dd>
      <dd>Charli XCX</dd>
      <dd>Rina Sawayama</dd>
      <dd>Black Midi</dd>
    </dl>

    I also like to see local musicians live in Cambridge.

    <h2>Production</h2>

    <p>
    My first taste of 'music production' was in 2016, when I started making mashups using Audacity and posting them on SoundCloud. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/c_c_c_c/bonfire-inc">One in particular</a> (external), a mashup of Childish Gambino's 3005 and Feel Good Inc. by the Gorillaz, ended up gaining a reasonable amount of internet traction.

    <br>
    <br>

    In around 2018, I started doing 'real' music production, making mostly hip-hop beats (that really don't sound very good). I now produce music using Ableton Live. Most of what I produce ends up gathering dust on my hard drive, but occasionally I end up making stuff that I think is worth showing the world.

    <br>
    <br>

    This is a breakcore-ish track, and the favourite track I've produced. I think I could improve the mix on the low-end a bit though.
    <br>

    <audio controls>
      <source src="files/d.wav" type="audio/wav">
    </audio>
    <br>
    <br>

    This is a short experiment I made to try out <a href="https://soniccharge.com/synplant">Synplant</a> (external). There's lots of room for more improvement/layers here, but I loved the process of making the sounds.
    <br>

    <audio controls>
      <source src="files/plants.wav" type="audio/wav">
    </audio>

    <br>
    <br>
    This is an ambient track I made by partial accident, trying to record my performance of Debussy's Arabesque No. 1 from my electric piano, and getting some weird chopping issues in Ableton. I thought it sounded really cool, so I added some effects and voila! This is one of my only tracks to have a name: 'Market Square'.
    <br>

    <audio controls>
      <source src="files/marketsquare.wav" type="audio/wav">
    </audio>
    <br>
    <br>

    I also occasionally update my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/c_c_c_c">SoundCloud</a> (external) with new tracks, and is the first place I usually release them (if they get released).
