    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <hr>
    <div>
    <p>Hi! I'm Joe Cheng, a computer science undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, and welcome to my personal website!</p>
    <p><img style="float: right;" src="files/me.jpeg" height=300 width=300/></p>
    <p>This website has my CV, links to GitHub/LinkedIn, and various pages containing my thoughts on things I find interesting. I'm also planning to start blogging. You can find links to all of these back on the <a href="index.html">home</a> page.
    <br>
    <br>
    Within computer science, I'm particularly interested in systems (computer architecture, computer networking, operating systems, etc.), embedded and low-level programming, computer music, and game development/graphics. Outside of computer science, I'm interested in music (both making and listening), cooking, and tea. I'm vegan, and have been for around 5-6 years.
